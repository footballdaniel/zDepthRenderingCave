# Instructions for preparing the greenscreen video

## Import video in Premiere Pro
- Open Premiere Pro CC
- Right click the [import](https://filmora.wondershare.com/adobe-premiere/adobe-premiere-import-export.html) section and select the video  
- In the project folder, right click on the imported video and chose "create sequence from clip". A new sequence with the same name is created just below the video file ([tutorial](https://helpx.adobe.com/ch_de/premiere-pro/how-to/create-edit-sequence.html)). Rightlick and rename the sequence, then double click to open  
- [Cut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhJuuPAzvg) video so that the video starts at the frame when the subject reaches the marker tape height after standing up  

## Apply Key for the Greenscreening effect
- Apply the "[Ultra Key](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-sZyzs-fnI)" Effect to the timeline.  
- The settings for the Ultra Key can bei imported from the Preset file (.../01_Scripts/UltraKeyPreset.prfpset). The preset file can be added to the Premiere Project [the following way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cV3XFTiRXt4)  
- In the "Effect Controls" window (Shift+5), the settings of the ultra Key can be adjusted. Most importantly, the settings under "Matte Generation" are of interest to mask all background  
- After the application, the background around the player should be subtracted and should yield a result like [this](https://imgur.com/1xUoAjd)
